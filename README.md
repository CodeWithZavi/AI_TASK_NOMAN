# 🤖 AI Search Algorithms + Student Marks Visualization (Python)

This project includes:

- 🔍 **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)**
- 🧠 **A* (A-Star) Algorithm**
- 📊 **Matplotlib Visualization for Student Marks**

---

## 🔍 Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)

An informed search algorithm that expands the node closest to the goal based on a heuristic.

- Takes a graph, start & goal node, and heuristic values.
- Chooses the path with the lowest heuristic estimate.
- Returns the shortest path based on the guess.

---

## 🧠 A* (A-Star) Algorithm

A powerful pathfinding algorithm that uses both path cost and heuristic:

- `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`
- `g(n)` = actual cost from start to current node.
- `h(n)` = estimated cost from current to goal.
- Guarantees optimal path if heuristic is admissible.

## 📊 Student Marks Plot (Matplotlib)

Visualizes a student's performance using Python’s Matplotlib.

- Plots:
  - Quiz marks (out of 15)
  - Assignment marks (out of 10)
  - Midterm marks (out of 35)
- Uses different markers and a legend for clarity.

## ✅ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Install matplotlib:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
3.Run the scripts in your Python editor.
